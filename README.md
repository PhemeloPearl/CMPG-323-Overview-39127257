## Branching Strategy

Each project repository will follow a branching strategy to facilitate collaborative development and version control. The recommended branching strategy includes:

- **Main Branch:** Main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) for stable, production-ready code.
- **Development Branch:** Development branch (e.g., `develop`) for ongoing development and integration of features.
- **Feature Branches:** Feature branches (named descriptively, e.g., `feature/new-feature`) for developing new features or fixes.

## .gitignore File

A `.gitignore` file will be used in each project repository to specify files and directories that should be ignored by Git. This ensures that sensitive or unnecessary files (e.g., build artifacts, IDE configurations) are not included in the repository.

## Storage of Credentials and Sensitive Information

To maintain security and prevent exposure of sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, and configuration settings:

- Store sensitive information in environment variables or secure vaults.
- Ensure that sensitive files are listed in the `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.
